                            <p style="font-size: 130%">Automotive engineering is a branch of vehicle engineering that focuses 
                            on the application, design and manufacturing of various types of automobiles. 
                            This field of engineering involves the direct application of mathematics 
                            in the design and production of vehicles. Engineering disciplines that may 
                            be practiced in this field include safety engineering, vehicle electronics, 
                            quality management and fuel economy and emissions. Automotive engineering 
                            may also be referred to as "automobile engineering".
                            Automotive engineers, also referred to as "automobile engineers", 
                            work with other engineers to enhance the technical performance, 
                            aesthetics and software of vehicles. Common responsibilities of an 
                            automotive engineer include designing and testing various components of 
                            vehicles, including fuel technologies and safety systems. They may also 
                            come up with and design new vehicle models or vehicle systems using 
                            engineer design software such as ThinkDesign Engineering.
