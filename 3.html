                            <p style="font-size: 130%">Biomedical engineering is the application of the principles and 
                            problem-solving techniques of engineering to biology and medicine. 
                            This is evident throughout healthcare, from diagnosis and analysis to 
                            treatment and recovery, and has entered the public conscience though the 
                            proliferation of implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers and 
                            artificial hips, to more futuristic technologies such as stem cell 
                            engineering and the 3-D printing of biological organs.

                            Engineering itself is an innovative field, the origin of ideas leading to 
                            verything from automobiles to aerospace, skyscrapers to sonar. Biomedical 
                            ngineering focuses on the advances that improve human health and health 
                            care at all levels.</p>
