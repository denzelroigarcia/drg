                            <p style="font-size: 130%">aerospace engineering, also called aeronautical engineering,
                             or astronautical engineering, field of engineering concerned with the
                             design, development, construction, testing, and operation of vehicles
                            operating in the Earth’s atmosphere or in outer space. In 1958 the 
                             first definition of aerospace engineering appeared, considering the 
                             Earth’s atmosphere and the space above it as a single realm for 
                            development of flight vehicles. Today the more encompassing aerospace 
                             definition has commonly replaced the terms aeronautical engineering and 
                             astronautical engineering.
                            The design of a flight vehicle demands a knowledge 
                             of many engineering disciplines. It is rare that one 
                            person takes on the entire task; instead, most 
                            companies have design teams specialized in the 
                            sciences of aerodynamics, propulsion systems, 
                            structural design, materials, avionics, and 
                            stability and control systems. No single design can 
                            optimize all of these sciences, but rather there exist 
                            compromised designs that incorporate the vehicle 
                             specifications, available technology, and economic 
                             feasibility.</p>
